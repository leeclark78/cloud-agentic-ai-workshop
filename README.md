# Cloud-Hosted Agentic AI Systems Workshop

## Overview

Welcome to this comprehensive workshop on building cloud-hosted agentic AI systems across Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud Platform (GCP), and Microsoft Azure. This hands-on experience will guide you through architecting, deploying, and scaling intelligent agents that can autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with various services in the cloud.

## What You Will Learn

By the end of this workshop, you will understand how to:

* Design and architect agentic AI systems using cloud-native services
* Implement autonomous agents that can reason, plan, and execute tasks
* Deploy scalable AI solutions across AWS, GCP, and Azure
* Integrate language models with cloud services for real-world applications
* Manage costs, security, and performance in production environments
* Build robust monitoring and observability for AI agents

## Workshop Structure

### Module 1: Foundations of Agentic AI
- Understanding autonomous agents and their capabilities
- Architecture patterns for cloud-hosted AI systems
- Key components: reasoning, planning, memory, and tool use

### Module 2: AWS Implementation
- Building agents with AWS Bedrock and Lambda
- Integrating with AWS services (S3, DynamoDB, SQS)
- Deploying with CDK and monitoring with CloudWatch

### Module 3: Google Cloud Implementation
- Creating agents with Vertex AI and Cloud Functions
- Connecting to GCP services (Cloud Storage, Firestore, Pub/Sub)
- Infrastructure as Code with Terraform
- Observability with Cloud Monitoring

### Module 4: Azure Implementation
- Developing agents with Azure OpenAI and Functions
- Integration with Azure services (Blob Storage, Cosmos DB, Service Bus)
- Deployment using ARM templates and Bicep
- Monitoring with Application Insights

### Module 5: Advanced Patterns
- Multi-agent systems and orchestration
- Cross-cloud deployment strategies
- Security best practices and governance
- Cost optimisation techniques
