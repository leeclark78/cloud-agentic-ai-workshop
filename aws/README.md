# AWS Agentic AI Implementation

## Overview

This section covers building agentic AI systems using Amazon Web Services. We'll leverage AWS Bedrock for foundation models, Lambda for serverless compute, and various AWS services for creating a complete autonomous agent ecosystem.

## Architecture Components

### Core Services
* **AWS Bedrock**: Access to foundation models (Claude, Llama, etc.)
* **AWS Lambda**: Serverless functions for agent logic
* **Amazon DynamoDB**: Fast NoSQL database for agent memory and state
* **Amazon S3**: Object storage for documents and artifacts
* **Amazon SQS**: Message queuing for agent communication
* **AWS Step Functions**: Orchestration of complex agent workflows

### Supporting Services
* **Amazon API Gateway**: RESTful APIs for agent interactions
* **AWS CloudWatch**: Monitoring and logging
* **AWS IAM**: Security and access management
* **Amazon CloudFront**: Content delivery and caching

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install AWS CLI
curl "https://awscli.amazonaws.com/awscli-exe-linux-x86_64.zip" -o "awscliv2.zip"
unzip awscliv2.zip
sudo ./aws/install

# Install AWS CDK
npm install -g aws-cdk

# Verify installation
aws --version
cdk --version
```

### Authentication Setup
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Or use environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION=us-east-1
```

## Lab Exercises

### Lab 1: Basic Agent with Bedrock
Create your first autonomous agent using AWS Bedrock and Lambda.

**Objectives:**
* Set up AWS Bedrock access
* Create a Lambda function for agent logic
* Implement basic reasoning and response generation

### Lab 2: Multi-Tool Agent
Build an agent that can use multiple AWS services as tools.

**Objectives:**
* Integrate with S3 for file operations
* Connect to DynamoDB for data storage
* Add SQS for message handling

### Lab 3: Conversational Memory
Implement persistent memory for ongoing conversations.

**Objectives:**
* Design conversation history storage
* Implement context retrieval
* Handle memory management and pruning

### Lab 4: Agent Orchestration
Create multiple agents that work together using Step Functions.

**Objectives:**
* Design multi-agent workflows
* Implement agent-to-agent communication
* Handle complex task decomposition

## Code Examples

Each lab includes:
* Complete Python code with proper error handling
* CDK infrastructure definitions
* Deployment scripts and configurations
* Testing utilities and examples

## Cost Considerations

### Estimated Costs (per month for moderate usage):
* AWS Bedrock: £50-£200 depending on model and usage
* Lambda: £5-£20 for compute time
* DynamoDB: £10-£30 for storage and operations
* S3: £5-£15 for storage
* Other services: £10-£25

### Cost Optimisation Tips:
* Use provisioned concurrency carefully
* Implement proper caching strategies
* Monitor and set up billing alerts
* Use appropriate DynamoDB capacity modes

## Security Best Practices

* Use IAM roles with minimal required permissions
* Encrypt data at rest and in transit
* Implement proper API authentication
* Regular security audits and updates
* Secure secrets management with AWS Secrets Manager

## Monitoring and Observability

* CloudWatch dashboards for agent performance
* Custom metrics for business logic
* Distributed tracing with AWS X-Ray
* Log aggregation and analysis
* Alerting for failures and anomalies

## Next Steps

After completing the AWS section:
* Compare with GCP and Azure implementations
* Explore multi-cloud deployment strategies
* Learn advanced agent patterns and techniques
